I am a master's student in the **MPRI (Paris)** program.  
My research interests are focused on **formal methods**, including:

- **Verification** â€” ensuring correctness of systems through model checking and proofs  
- **Logic and automata** â€” key tools for reasoning about infinite behaviors and structured data  
- **Connections to AI** â€” using formal guarantees to make symbolic reasoning and generation more reliable  

I am motivated by bridging the gap between **theoretical models** and **practical verification tools**, exploring how formal theory can provide solid guarantees for the reliability of complex systems.

## ðŸŽ“ Education

- **UniversitÃ© Paris-Saclay / ENS Paris-Saclay** â€” Master Parisien de Recherche en Informatique  
  *2024 â€“ 2026 (expected)*  
  Focus: logic, formal methods, automata theory, verification, and algorithms  

- **UniversitÃ© Paris-Saclay** â€” Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science and Mathematics  
  *2021 â€“ 2024*  
  Double degree program combining computer science and mathematics

## ðŸ’¼ Internships

- **Research Internship â€” LMF, ENS Paris-Saclay / UniversitÃ© Paris-Saclay**  
  *Springâ€“Summer 2025 (MPRI M1)*  
  **Supervisor:** StÃ©phane Demri  
  **Topic:** Automata-based decision procedures for description logics with concrete domains  
  - Studied nonemptiness problems for tree automata with global constraints (TGCA)  
  - Proved correctness and complexity bounds (ExpTime) for reasoning in ALC(D)/ALCI(D)

- **Research Internship â€” LMF, UniversitÃ© Paris-Saclay**  
  *Summer 2024 (Bachelorâ€™s)*  
  **Supervisor:** Burkhart Wolff  
  **Topic:** Integrating Isabelle/HOL with the FDR4 model checker  
  - Implemented the Isabelle/FDR integration workflow connecting HOL-CSP with FDR4  
  - Developed import/export pipeline (CSPM generator in Isabelle, C++ plugin for FDR4, JSON re-import)  
  - Designed Isabelle/Isar commands for user interaction  
  - Applied the tool to case studies such as CopyBuffer and Dining Philosophers
